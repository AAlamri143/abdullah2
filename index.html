                        <p>I am Abdullah Alamri. I am originally from Saudi Arabia and I have been in the United States since 2009. Edmond, Oklahoma was my first city to visit and study. I finished my bachelor in business from University of Central Oklahoma. Also, I finished my Master degree when I got back to Saudi Arabia. After I relocated to Richmond, VA I had a plan to be a professional in programing; that is why I am here in University of Richmond.

                        <p>I started my carreir on 2004 as a "Warehouseman". Now, I work as "Head of Stock Control" and lead group of workers. I am so happy in my job, but I want to start my own business. I took the descion to learn coding after I call many companies from all the world to creat a new website. They told me that professional websites will cost from $15,000 till $25,000. Then I decided to accept the challange to learn how to be a professional developer and creat as many website as I like for free.
